# TODOs

-   [ ] Consider incorporating the questionnaire source TOML files directly into this pkg.

    Pro: Less error-prone; truth anchor generation would work without fokus_private repo and at build time!

    Contra: Our questionnaire sources would become AGPL-3-licensed and publicly accessable. Any real threats?
