For part of this package's functionality, a separate private directory (defined by the R option `fokus.path_private`) is required which is expected to be organized according to a very specific structure. This private directory i.a. must contain additional non-public (survey) data under the `data/` subdirectory and certain files are written to its subdirectory `output/`.
