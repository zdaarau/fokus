For part of this package's functionality, a separate private directory (defined by the [package configuration
option](https://fokus.rpkg.dev/reference/pkg_config.html) `path_private`) is required which is expected to be organized according to a very specific structure.
This private directory i.a. must contain additional sensitive, non-public (survey) data under the `input/` subdirectory and certain files are written to its
`output/` subdirectory.
