For part of this package's functionality, a [personal access token (PAT) of a gitlab.com account](https://gitlab.com/-/user_settings/personal_access_tokens)
with access to the `r glue::glue("[private FOKUS repository]({fokus:::url_repo_private()})")` is required. This repository contains additional sensitive,
non-public (survey) data under the `raw/` subdirectory and certain files are written to its `generated/` subdirectory.
